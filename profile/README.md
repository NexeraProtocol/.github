Home to the [**ERC-7208**](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7208) standard.

ERC-7208 is the standard to make all other standards interoperable. **On-chain data containers** are Smart Contracts that store both data and metadata and can be modified (mutable), expanded upon (extensible), and integrated with other assets (composable). Most standards require the storage of information to be within the same smart contract as the logic for managing said storage. ERC-7208 abstracts the logic from the data, bringing versatility to the ecosystem.

## The Nexera Protocol
The [Nexera Protocol](https://nexeraprotocol.com) is the Reference Implementation of the [ERC-7208](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7208), and as such it acts as a blockchain-agnostic infrastructure layer.
 - Information is stored as Property data within the ODC.
 - Properties can have Restrictions, governing how and when the Property data is modifiable.
 - Property Managers are smart contracts that can modify the Property Data and Restrictions.
 - ERC-7208 enables data to have multiple interfaces (ERCs) concurrently, as the logic of implementation is abstracted from the storage.

The **Nexera Protocol** is a cutting-edge, blockchain-based protocol that aims to provide a novel way for engaging with digital interactions. It harnesses the transformative power of distributed ledger technology to create a comprehensive ecosystem that's secure, decentralized, and above all user-centric.

Data is at the core of all digital interactions. As Blockchain Technologies continues to mature and expand, it is becoming increasingly important to enable more flexible and sophisticated on-chain data management solutions.

By placing mutable data containers (*ODCs*) in a central position, the Nexera Protocol provides dynamic and polymorphic storage capabilities that abstract the logic of smart contracts from the data stored within them.

In particular, mutable data containers have been identified as a critical missing piece in the on-chain data ecosystems. The **Nexera Protocol** addresses the limitations of traditional solutions by enabling on-chain data mutability and providing a framework for standardized, interoperable, and composable data containers:

- Procedurally generating Metadata from the information stored within the MetaNFT
- Storing arbitrary amounts of data within the DataStorage Library (dynamic Properties)
- Restrictions based on programmable conditions (transfer restriction, locking assets, internal and external hooks)
- Wrapping of native assets (ERC tokens, both current as well as future implementations)
- Fractionalization, merging, attaching, and detaching of information
- Tokenization of real assets (both tangible as well as intangible)
- Exposing multiple interfaces for the same data container (PropertyManagers)
- Identity management (ZKP, Compliance Rule Engine)
- Smart Wallet (Account Abstraction, programmable rules, recovery rules, automated transactions, etc)
- On-chain oracle aggregation with subscription, payment streaming, and automated on-chain triggers (i.e. for rebalancing a DeFi position based on a tokenized strategy)
- Agnostic staking solutions (multiple inputs and multiple reward strategies)
