## The Nexera Protocol
The [Nexera Protocol](https://nexeraprotocol.com) is a blockchain agnostic infrastructure layer.

The **Nexera Protocol** is a cutting-edge, blockchain-based protocol that aims to provide a novel way for engaging with digital interactions. It harnesses the transformative power of distributed ledger technology to create a comprehensive ecosystem that's secure, decentralized, and above all user-centric.

Data is at the core of all digital interactions. As Blockchain Technologies continues to mature and expand, it is becoming increasingly important to enable more flexible and sophisticated on-chain data management solutions.

By placing mutable data containers (NFTs) in a central position, the protocol is derived from the [MetaNFT Standard](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/7210) in order to include dynamic and polymorphic storage capabilities.

In particular, mutable data containers have been identified as a critical missing piece in the on-chain data ecosystems. The **Nexera Protocol** addresses the limitations of traditional solutions by enabling on-chain data mutability and providing a framework for standardized, interoperable, and composable data containers:

- Procedurally generating Metadata from within the information stored within the MetaNFT
- Storing arbitrary amounts of information within the DataStorage Library (dynamic Properties)
- Restrictions based on programmable conditions (transfer restriction, locking assets, internal and external hooks)
- Wrapping of native assets (ERC tokens, both current as well as future implementations)
- Fractionalization, merging, attaching, and detaching of information
- Tokenization of real assets (both tangible as well as intangible)
- Exposing multiple interfaces for the same data container (PropertyManagers)
- Identity management(opens in a new tab) (ZKP, Compliance Rule Engine)
- Smart Wallet(opens in a new tab) (Account Abstraction, programmable rules, recovery rules, automated transactions, etc)
- On-chain oracle aggregation with subscription, payment streaming, and automated on-chain triggers (i.e. for rebalancing a DeFi position based on a tokenized strategy).
